## About Advent of Code

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

Every year from December 1st to December 25th, a new set of puzzles is released. Each day a two-part puzzle is public on Midnight EST (UTC-5). Solving part 1 unlocks part 2 which continues the puzzle but may add difficulty and/or complexity. Each part gives you a star upon completion, and you could earn up to 50 stars each year.

**Note that from year 2025 and onwards, due to personal availability of the maker of Advent of Code, there would be only 12 days of puzzles released each year, from 1st of December to 12th of December.**

## About this repository

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code (year 2020 to 2025 for the moment). Each year's puzzles are stored in a separate folder, named after the year. Within each year's folder, you will find the solutions for each day's puzzles.

The solutions are currently implemented in Python. Each file contains the solution for a specific day's puzzle, with the filename corresponding to the day (e.g., `day_01.py` for Day 1).

Please note that these solutions are my own work and are provided for reference purposes. While I have tried to solve each puzzle correctly, there may be more efficient or elegant solutions.
